1. Using the pairwise process to make a class decision</h3>

One of the basic tools of AHP/ANP theory is the process of pairwise comparing a
set of items to understand their overall importance. &nbsp;The idea is you have a
collection of items you wish to rank from best to worst (sports teams, for instance),
with some notion of how much better each one is than the previous one. &nbsp;This task
can be difficult to do directly, and so instead we pairwise compare the items. &nbsp; For instance:
<ul>
  <li>Say we have teams <b>A, B, C, D</b>&nbsp;that we wish to rank.</li>
  <li>We instead pairwise compare them by answering:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Which is better <b>A</b>&nbsp;or <b>B</b>, and how much better is it (on a scale of 1-9, 1 meaning equals,
      9 meaning much much better)?</li>
    <li>Which is better <b>B</b>&nbsp;or <b>C</b>, and how much?</li>
    <li>Which is better <b>C</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>D</b>, and how much?</li>
    <li>Which is better&nbsp;<b>A</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>C</b>, and how much?</li>
    <li>Which is better&nbsp;<b>B</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>D</b>, and how much?</li>
    <li>Which is better&nbsp;<b>A</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>D</b>, and how much?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>There is some mathematics done on these numbers, that then would give you
    scores between 0 and 1 for each of <b>A, B, C, D</b>&nbsp;respectively. &nbsp;
    These scores then tell us which one is better and by how much.</li>
</ul>

<div><h5>Project Idea:</h5>
  A student could choose a question that her whole class needs to answer,
  for instance where the classes next outing should be. &nbsp;The student would
  need to collect the alternatives, and create a questionnaire similar to&nbsp;
  <a href="https://github.com/wjladams/youth-isahp/blob/master/QuestionnaireSimplified/SampleAHPQuestionnaire.jpg" style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:13.3333px;background-image:initial;background-color:rgb(231,231,231);background-repeat:initial" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">
    the sample questionnaire</a>&nbsp;and put those answers in an excel file. &nbsp;
    That file could then be fed into our application to calculate resulting priorities and visual the results.
     &nbsp;The student could then interpret those results (and discover if the boys and girls in the class
     differ, and how; or perhaps how the classes opinions differ by age group; or what is the trend as age
     goes up on each of the options).

2. Write a program to take pairwise comparisons and turn them into priorities</h3>

The mathematics involved in taking pairwise comparisons and turning them into
priorities uses the eigenvectors of the pairwise comparison matrix.
In particular the largest eigenvector, i.e. the eigenvector with the largest
eigenvalue.  There are several ways to go about finding the largest eigenvector
of a matrix.  A student could implement such an algorithm in a language of
their choice, and write some samples calculations to verify their algorithm
works.  There are many accessible programming languages a student could choose
to use, e.g. Python, Java, Javascript, C, C++.   Freely available tools, e.g.
sagemath, have the builtin capacity to calculate the all of the eigenvectors
of a given matrix and could be used for verification.

3. Create an ANP model with the freely available Super Decisions application</h3>

ANP is more intricate form of AHP, but it can still be accessible for simple problems.
 Dr. Adams developed a teaching and research application called
 <a href="http://superdecisions.com">SuperDecisions</a>
 that can be used to create ANP models for decision making.
  Dr. Rokou is continuing Dr. Adams work and working on an updated release of
  SuperDecisions to be available shortly.

  <h5>Project Idea 1:</h5>
 A student could research an interesting decision for
 their class, and model that decision in SuperDecisions.
 <h5>Project Idea 2:</h5>
 Another option is to use SuperDecisions to predict market share.
  A market share problem can be something like
   "Which restaurant will get the most business?" to
    "What percentage of the vote is a presidential candidate likely to get?".
