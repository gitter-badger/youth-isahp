Welcome, if you are here then either you are considering participation in the Youth
Session at ISAHP 2016 in London <a href="http://isahp.org">http://isahp.org</a>, or
you are interested in using the tool Dr. Adams wrote to get pairwise information
from google forms and produce individual, group, and subgroup priorities.
In either case you can see an example of the results of using this process at
<a href="http://bit.ly/music-choice-example-results">Music Preference Example</a>.

1. Background Material
</h3>
AHP is a multicriterion decision method developed by Dr. Saaty in the 1970's.
It has several pieces to it, including a method of breaking down complex
decisions into simpler elements, the decision hierarchy.  In addition there
is a method for understanding how important various pieces of the decision
are, called the pairwise comparison method.  A brief introduction to AHP
theory can be found at <a href="https://mi.boku.ac.at/ahp/ahptutorial.pdf">AHP
Tutorial</a>, and pages 7-10 of that document discuss pairwise comparisons.
<p>
This tool only covers the pairwise comparison part of AHP theory.  However,
this tool can be used to do multiple voter pairwise comparisons in an
elegant and very visual method.

2. How To Pick An Interesting Problem
</h3>
Pairwise comparisons are used to find an individual's or group's opinion on
a particular set of alternatives.  Pairwise comparisons not only let us find out
an individual, or group's preferences, but how strong those preferences are.
<p>
<u>Example:</u> We want to know folks preferences for types of music.  For
instance, in a classroom we are going to allow music to be played during
lunch time.  We have 4 play lists to choose from, Rock, Country, Pop, and
Classical.  We would like to play the music that most people want to hear,
taking into consideration if folks really like or hate a particular type.
<p>
  Pairwise comparisons is a perfect method for solving this problem.  We
  would ask our students to answer the following questions:
  <ul>
    <li> Which is better, Rock or Country, and by how much on a scale of 2-9?
    <li> Which is better, Country or Pop, and by how much on a scale of 2-9?
    <li> Which is better, Pop or Classical, and by how much on a scale of 2-9?
    <li> Which is better, Rock or Pop, and by how much on a scale of 2-9?
    <li> Which is better, Country or Classical, and by how much on a scale of 2-9?
    <li> Which is better, Rock or Classical, and by how much on a scale of 2-9?
  </ul>
  The AHP pairwise process allows us to take that data and turn it into overall
  preferences for individuals and the group for each of these types of music.
  Whichever music type is preferred by the group is the one we should generally
  play.
  <p>
  <u>Picking a good problem:</u>  A good problem for this pairwise process should
  follow these general rules.
  <ol>
    <li> We have a group of alternatives that we want to know the group's preference of.
      For example, the music types mentioned above.
    <li> Make the alternatives you are choosing between interesting to your participants.
      For instance, choosing a favorite programming language would not be interesting
      to a general audience, but would be interesting to computer tech folks.
    <li> There should be at least 3 alternatives we are choosing between (to make it interesting)
      and there should generally be 7 or less alternatives.  Note: if you have 7 alternatives
      there will be 21 questions, which is quite a lot.  However if you truly
      have a lot of choices, you can ask less questions and still get good results.
    <li> Include demographic data about your participants.  With that demographic
      data, e.g. age, favorite color, gender, etc, you can look at the differences
      and similarities between group opinions.  For instance, perhaps girls prefer
      Rock music and boys prefer Classical in your group.
  </ol>

3. How to choose alternatives
</h3>
Once we have the question formulated, and a preliminary set of alternative, i.e.
a set of things we want to know folks preferences about, try to follow these
rules for your alternative names.
<ol>
  <li>The alternative names should be short, but informative.
  <li>If you have more than 7 alternatives, consider coalescing your alternatives
    down to a smaller grouping.  In our music example, we may have started off
    with Punk Rock, Alternative, Metal, and Progressive Rock, all as options.
    We could coalesce those into a single "Rock" option.
  <li> Alternately if you have 7 or more alternatives, and you feel you must
    keep them all, you should probably not pairwise compare every alternative
    to every other alternative.  For 7 alternatives that is 21 questions, for
    8 it is 28 questions, 9 it is 36, etc.  Your audience will most likely
    get bored and annoyed by answering all of those questions.  Instead you
    can choose a limited selection of pairwise comparisons to perform and still
    arrive at valid results.
</ol>
